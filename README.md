# iPetIt
iPetIt is a free app that lets pet owners and pet-trainers or pet-sitters come along (Connect & Communicate).

More specifically:

From a user's perspective, pet owners can list their pets and provide all the necessary information about them (Breed, Male - Female, etc).
Then, owners are able to choose a pet-trainer/instructor or a pet-sitter in order to train the pet or pet-sit it.
Except from this service, pet owners are able to find additional information about their pets such as: recommended nourishments, vaccines, medicine, etc.

From a pet-trainer's or a pet-sitter's perspective, both are able to check the pets that get listed. If the pet-trainers or pet-sitters have the appropriate specialty, they can confirm that they are able to get the job and proceed with it.

More intel about the app:

iPetIt is fully supported and funded exclusively by ads. We do not charge for anything. We should also mention that we are not responsible for any misunderstandings between pet-owners and pet-trainers or pet-sitters.
Main goal of us, the creators of iPetIt is the evolution and empowerment of our skills and knowledge.
The app is currently supported by two developers and the project manager, which also happens to be the one that had the idea. All of us are real close friends.

-Initially Thought and Developed by two friends that started iPetIt as a fun project-
